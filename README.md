Voice vs exit is an important concept in political science.

If a company or country is in decline, people can try voice or exit to create a better institution.   
Voice: change the system from within.  
Exit: leave to create a new system or join a competitor. 

Exit and voice are both important, but exit amplifies voice.

Exit is opt-in and peaceful. Exit priortitizes building better alternatives rather than fighting over existing power. 

Through exit, we can build better companies, currencies, and countries. 

Examples from @Naval's tweet: 
Bitcoin is an exit from the Fed.
DeFi is an exit from Wall Street.
Social media is an exit from mass media.
Homeschooling is an exit from industrial education.
Remote work is an exit from 9-5.
Creator economy is an exit from employment.
Individuals are leaving institutions.
