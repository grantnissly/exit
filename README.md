Exit is a fundamental right. 

Voice vs. Exit. 

If a company or country is in decline, you can try voice or exit. 

Voice: change the system from within (voting). 
Exit: leave to create a new system or join a competitor. 

Exiting institutions is fundamental to making change to a system. Exit also gives voice more power. It amplifies voice. 

Exit is peaceful. In exit, people opt-in to better way of doing things. 


Examples from @Naval's tweet: 
Bitcoin is an exit from the Fed.
DeFi is an exit from Wall Street.
Social media is an exit from mass media.
Homeschooling is an exit from industrial education.
Remote work is an exit from 9-5.
Creator economy is an exit from employment.
Individuals are leaving institutions.
